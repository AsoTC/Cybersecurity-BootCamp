Part 1
Question 3 - There are many different programming languages due to their usage and complexity. You
have languages like Assembly, C, C++ that are more complex since they work closer to the hardware layer
where you have manage allocating and dealloating resourcces (memory, threads, I/O) of the computer. Where 
languages like Java, C# handle managing these resources for the programmer. Assembly, C, C++ woudl be used where
performance of the software really mattered or in something like an embedded system that has minimal resources. Java
and C# are better general use languages. Then there are languages like ADA that are using in military systems and other critical
systems where buggy software would be bad. 


Part 2
I am looking for this course to help fill in the gaps in my self-taugt knowledge of networking and security concepts. I 
currently work in the IT space responsible for web hosting infrastructure, security (software and network) and answering 
secruity requests from clients. Previous to this role, I have 15 years in programmign experience which is where I also periphially picked up 
network and security background.  Things I am looking for that would be immediately beneficial are security policy and frameworks, data classification, governance
Things that i am interested in learning more are pen testing, powershell, cloud networking and security.  I would also like to be prepared to work on passing 
the Security+ certification.
