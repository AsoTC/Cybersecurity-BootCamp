From my findings, the dealer working at the time of all the losses was Billy Jones and player he was working with was Mylie Schmidt. Every day and time that there were losses(15 occurences over 3 days) Billy Jones was working the roulette table. 

The common player playing during all these losses was Mylie Schmidt (13 occureances over the same 3 days).
